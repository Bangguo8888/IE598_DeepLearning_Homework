# Homework 2
A) Derive the backpropagation algorithm for a multi-layer feedforward neural network with dropout.  State the stochastic gradient descent algorithm for this neural network.  
B) Train a convolutional neural network on MNIST with TensorFlow.  Report the test accuracy with and without dropout. The model should be trained on a GPU.  
C) Train a deep convolutional neural network on CIFAR10. The model should be trained on a GPU. Report the test accuracy for different numbers of layers and different dropout probabilities.  Also, train a deep convolutional network with data augmentation and report the test accuracy.
