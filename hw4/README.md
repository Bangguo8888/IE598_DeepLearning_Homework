# Home Work 4 - Understanding CNNs and Generational Adversarial Networks
The assignment consists of training a Generative Adversarial Network on the CIFAR10 dataset as well as a few visualization tasks for better understanding what a CNN is doing.  

The assignment will be split into two main parts. The first is for writing the code defining the full GAN training process. The second is for the visualization tasks.  

Pictures generated by Generational Adversarial Networks is [here](https://github.com/Bangguo8888/IE598_DeepLearning_Homework/blob/master/hw4/20_interval_images.gif) (dynamic changes, from fuzzy to clear).
